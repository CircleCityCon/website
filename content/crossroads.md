CircleCity Crossroads is an annual information security executive day prior to CircleCityCon in Indianapolis.
Last year we had 100 executives of IT and Information Security come to our conference for a day of meaningful discussions, great networking, and peeking into the future of Cyber Security.
This year we are pleased to return with even more content and great discussions planned.


If you are a C-level, Vice-President, or Executive Director with IT or Information Security as your domain, we welcome you to join us for a day of networking, talks, panels, and executive round table discussions about topics that matter most to you!
