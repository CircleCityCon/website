This year marks the launch of our inaugural CircleCityCrossroads. This is an executive summit, which is a joint partnership between CircleCityCon, Infragard, and ISSA.The summit will occur the day before the regular CircleCityCon conference.


If you are a C-level, Vice-President, or Executive Director with IT or Information Security as your domain, we welcome you to join us for a day of networking, talks, panels, and executive round table discussions about topics that matter most to you!
