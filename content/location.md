CircleCityCon this year is located at the beautiful [Westin Indianapolis](https://www.starwoodmeeting.com/events/start.action?id=1801116101&key=1CBE8A0B) in downtown Indianapolis.  We have been at the Westin in years past and the venue has worked well for us.  We also have a room block at the hotel (not yet available) available for you to use for accommodations at the venue.
