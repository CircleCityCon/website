Due to the prevalence and business impact of malware, security professionals increasingly need the skills necessary to analyze malware. This two day course teaches attendees the proven concepts, techniques and processes for examining malicious code. Students will take multiple "from-the-wild" malware samples in a hands-on environment and learn how to analyze their characteristics and behavior to determine what they do and what risk they present. 

No previous malware analysis experience is necessary as this course is designed for those who have never performed malware analysis before.
