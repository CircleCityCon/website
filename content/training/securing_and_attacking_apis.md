title: "Securing and Attacking APIs"

---

With the increased, and eventually complete, reliance on APIs in modern systems, as well as the quick decline of the monolithic architecture for systems and applications; it is becoming increasingly necessary to tackle and understand the various security issues, weaknesses and gotchas in API designs. Many products, platforms and technologies now expose an API or two (or many more), sometimes in decentralized and autonomous fashion. Where does security come in this new world of rapid build-up and teardown of microservices and serverless (functionality as a Service - Faas) architectures?

How do web and mobile apps securely communicate with APIs through devices they can't trust, network paths they cannot predict, and on infrastructure they don't own? 
All of that, and many more, will be studied, tried, tested and answered in this fast-paced, scenario-based hands on training course.

This course will discuss various attacks and countermeasures for security issues typically found in API servers and clients such as authentication, injection attacks, credential handling, cryptography, authorization, caching, secure file and resource management, and many more.
This training aims to engage students in design, analysis and breakdown of security in clientside and serverside components of modern APIs and application infrastructure, while combining both new and old attack vectors and pitfalls. This course doesn't reinvent the wheel in security, but it will help you not to reinvent the old bugs.
