Information security is in the process of coming out of the dark which means more people are willing to listen to advice on how to be more secure. This is great because there is a lot of behavior change needed to improve security basically anywhere you go. However, the fact that they’re listening now doesn’t mean they’ll actually take the advice – and plenty of people still aren’t listening. Learn communication skills to improve your chances of affecting behavior change. Learn skills for a variety of situations and a variety of audiences. This training will cover some basic communication skills, how to analyze an audience,  and how to develop and deliver persuasive messages.
