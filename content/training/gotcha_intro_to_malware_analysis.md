We'll dive into detecting the origin and effects of malware on our system using a combination of static and dynamic tools that are freely available online (no high falutin' commercial sandboxes here!).  This workshop will give an introduction to basic *Malware Analysis* as well as plenty of pointers for those who want to explore further.  *This is not a lecture, we will break things together*!

This workshop is for penetration testers, students, n00bs, Law Enforcement, and anybody interested in the study of Malware who've had limited experience or exposure so far or who would like to explore CTF’s.  

Participants will need a laptop with VMWare or VirtualBox, two VM's pre-installed as well as a list of free tools that will be posted with links prior to CCC.
Familiarity with Command Line Interfaces, Virtual Machines and Networking is strongly recommended.  A basic understanding of Windows Architecture is beneficial as well.  Malware sample will be provided along with copies of slides and links on a USB during training, there will be nominal prizes for participation and general awesomeness.  (*Hint*: Watching the underappreciated 1985 espionage thriller *Gotcha!* won’t hurt your chances when hunting flags either!)
