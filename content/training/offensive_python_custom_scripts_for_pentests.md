title: "Offensive Python: Custom scripts for pentests"

---

In this workshop, we'll write custom Python scripts to automate and augment penetration testing. Learn the basics of port scanning, crafting custom packets, and building your own exploits in Python.

We will work through examples using a Jupyter Notebook, which you can make a copy of to play around with after the conference. (To get the most out of this class, you should already have some basic programming experience in Python or a similar programming language like Ruby.)
