title: "Learning to Hack Bluetooth Low Energy with BLE CTF"

---

While BLE CTF is in fact a cft, it was created as a series of learning exercises to teach the fundamentals of interacting with and hacking Bluetooth Low Energy.  Each exercise, or flag, aims to iteratively teach a new concept to the user.  For this workshop, we will step through a series of exercises to teach beginner students new concepts and allow more seasoned users to try new tools and techniques. After completing this workshop, you should have a good solid understanding of how to interact with and hack on BLE devices in the wild.

If you have done BLE CTF in the past, this class is still valuable.  This class will be based off of a complete rewrite of BLE CTF which is being released as version 2.0.  It will still have many of the challenges from 1.0, but restructured, where every flag is hosted in a completely separate GATT service.  Along with the v1.0 flags, new new version allows for more advanced challenges which were not possible in the past.
