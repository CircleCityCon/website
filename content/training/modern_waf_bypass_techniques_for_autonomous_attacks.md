title: "Modern WAF Bypass Techniques for Autonomous Attacks"

---

Scripting and automation are absolutely critical to many aspects of an attacker’s effectiveness, penetration tester or otherwise. Modern WAFs and “bot detections” often add a small layer of intelligence to their monitoring, attempting to determine whether or not an attack is being automated, and shut the bot/botnet down. This class will cover how common forms of WAF & bot detections work and how you can modify your scripting to fly under the radar.

**Class Structure:**

Instruction will be extremely hands-on, targetting a live website with common protections in place. Students are expected to have enough knowledge in Python and/or Javascript (both are preferred, JS is absolutely required) to be able to write basic scripts for accessing data via HTTP, as this will be a "we all teach each other" style of course. Students will be tasked with writing their own scripts using the recommended techniques and demonstrate their methodologies to the rest of the class.


**Requirements:**
 
* Windows. MacOS or Linux laptop & permission/ability to install software (i.e. Python, node.js, Webstorm or other IDE(if desired)) and create new network interfaces (VPN, etc).

* Basic ability to write Python and Javascript for the purposes of automating HTTP requests

* General knowledge of the HTTP protocol (basic webapp functionality, how headers work)

* Ability and desire to present and explain one’s own work to a small group
