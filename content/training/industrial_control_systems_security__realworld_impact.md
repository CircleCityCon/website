Industrial Control Systems (ICS) are at the heart of many processes and infrastructure touching our daily lives. Manufacturing lines at a company that creates your favorite beverage or treat are one example! ICS also exists in areas we take for granted like Water and Wastewater Treatment Plants. The government identifies some systems as Critical Infrastructure that are essential for the functioning of a society and economy. ICS security can affect the risk to a company√¢&euro;&trade;s finances or can be associated with life and death consequences!

No experience with ICS is assumed. ICS basics, hardware, and software will be covered including Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC), Remote Terminal Units (RTU), Distributed Control Systems (DCS), Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA), and more.  Two real-life ICS attacks will be discussed. Play the evil side in the first set of labs by creating an industrial mixing process for Srsly Not Bad, Co. as they prepare to manipulate the minds of citizens.  Then save the world as a good spy, sabotaging the process in subtle or not so subtle ways!

Arduino OpenPLC devices will be provided for use.  Attendees will need to provide their own laptop capable of running provided VirtualBox VMs.
