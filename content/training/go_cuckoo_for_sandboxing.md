Cuckoo Sandbox is the leading open source automated malware analysis system. You can throw any suspicious file at it and in a matter of minutes Cuckoo will provide a detailed report outlining the behavior of the file when executed inside a realistic but isolated environment. In these evolving times, detecting and removing malware artifacts is not enough: it's vitally important to understand how they operate in order to understand the context, the motivations, and the goals of a breach. Cuckoo Sandbox is free software that automated the task of analyzing any malicious file under Windows, OS X, Linux, and Android.

What to bring:

A robust laptop (RAM >= 8GB; HDD free space >= 30 GB; and as always more is better) with Ubuntu 16.04 installed & up to date (Ubuntu can be on a virtual machine with 30 GB HDD).

We will be building Cuckoo using VirtualBox so I recommend using a different Virtual software to install Ubuntu (VMWare Player is free for non-commercial use: https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player/workstation-player-evaluation.html)
