We'll explore a victimized (or was it?) system using Volatility, a fantastic open source memory forensics tool. This workshop will give an introduction to forensic analysis and reporting as well as plenty of pointers for those who want to explore further. 
This workshop is for penetration testers, students, n00bs, Law Enforcement, and anybody interested in the study of compromised system images who've had limited experience or exposure so far or who would like to know more of what can be discovered in volatile memory (RAM).
Participants will need a laptop with Python 2.7 installed, a copy of the Volatility Framework, and the memory image posted in a github repo to be released prior to CCC.
Familiarity with Command Line Interfaces, Windows OS Architecture, and Networking is strongly recommended. There will be nominal prizes for participation and general awesomeness. (Hint: Watching the underappreciated 1985 espionage thriller Gotcha! won√¢&euro;&trade;t hurt your chances when hunting flags either!)
