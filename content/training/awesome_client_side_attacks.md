This hands-on class will walk-through several web-client vulnerabilities. A series of labs will focus on analyzing the specific characteristics of the flaws and how they can be leveraged and combined into impactful proofs-of-concept. Main areas of focus will include an offensive web skills primer, creative CORS abuse, CSRF, UI redress attacks. Time-permitting, some advanced cross-site scripting attacks as well.

This class is geared towards pen-testers and enthusiasts with at least a basic understanding of HTTP and HTML, and some experience coding or scripting (any language). Laptop required. Lab VMs will be provided.
