This entry-level, hands-on training will introduce students to Splunk in the context of everyday information-security tasks.  We'll understand what Splunk is (and what it isn’t), go over architecture and deployment scenarios, and take a bird eye’s view of how Splunk works behind the scenes.  We’ll review the Search Processing Language and use it for basic querying of large datasets, as we investigate suspicious account and machine activities.  We’ll then dive into more complex searches and create interesting queries, reports, dashboards, and alerts, all applicable to investigations, monitoring, and incident response.
No previous Splunk experience is necessary!  Students are expected to understand basic Windows/Linux commands, audit logs, and network infrastructure.

This is a hands-on class.  Students will need to bring their own computer, and create a free account on Splunk.com.  We’ll use Splunk’s web-based sandbox environment during the class for searching and alerting
