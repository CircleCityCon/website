Over 25 years in the Security field, with an emphasis on Security Operations, Incident Response and Purple Teams. Based in Chicago and a natural creature of winter, you can typically find me sipping Casa Noble Anejo whilst simultaneously defending my computer networks using OSS, magic spells and Dancing Flamingos against a barrage of attackers.
