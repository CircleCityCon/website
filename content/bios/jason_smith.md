Self Taught Full Stack Developer, Code Louisville Mentor, and InfoSec Generalist.  I love helping others with everything technology and am passionate about getting kids coding, hacking, tinkering and thinking about technology as a means to positively impacting the world around them.  My son has fully embraced the Con life with me and begun his own self-learning journey and I couldn't be happier!
