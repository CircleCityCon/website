I am a Cyber Security Analyst who does hobbyist research on the side.  A lot of my research and proof of concepts are based on subjects Iâ€™ve heard on podcasts (or read about) and then create my own creative spin on the concept.  Currently I have three certifications from various institutions revolving around cyber security and continue to work towards more as I shape my professional career.
