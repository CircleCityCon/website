April C. Wright is a hacker, Oâ€™Reilly author, teacher, and community leader who has been breaking, making, fixing, and defending the security of global critical communications and connections for over 25 years. She is an international speaker and trainer, educating and advising on matters of privacy and information security with the goal of safeguarding the digital components we rely on every day. April has held roles on defensive, operational, adversarial, and development teams throughout her career, and has spoken and contributed to numerous worldwide security conferences including BlackHat, DEF CON USA and DEF CON China, DerbyCon, Hack in Paris, DefCamp Romania, ITWeb South Africa, as well as for the US Government and industry organizations such as OWASP and ISSA. She has started multiple small businesses including a non-profit, handles communications for DEF CON Groups community outreach, and in 2017 she co-founded a popular local Boston community event (DC617). April has collected dozens of certifications to add capital letters at the end of her name, and almost died in Dracula's secret staircase. She once read on The Onion that researchers at the University of North Carolina released a comprehensive report in 2014 confirming her status as the "most significant and interesting person currently inhabiting the earth", and it was on 'teh internet' so it must be true.
