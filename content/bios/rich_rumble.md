Rich likes talking in the 3rd person, long walks on secure beaches. Rich likes soft LED lit dinners and has unrequited love for Bruce Schneier. Rich feels that last line made him sound creepy, but thinks anyone who takes the time to get to know Rich will understand. Rich has to know how things work and takes everything apart as soon as it arrives. Rich calls the re-assembly process "reenginering" because there are always items left over. Due to this fact, Rich is on the do-not-fly list. Rich has been called a "wildcard" and he shoots from the hip, come see what all the fuss if about.
