As an active duty US Army Counterintelligence Agent (6 yrs), Judy provided weekly SAEDA briefings for new incoming unit soldiers and for yearly awareness training requirements.

Her experiences include training in traditional espionage tradecraft, along with supervising and conducting counterintelligence investigations of individuals, organizations, installations and activities in order to detect, assess and counter threats to national security. After leaving the Army, Judy started a civilian career in information security as:  domain admin for a global company, an IT manager implementing incident response system, Fraud department investigating people stealing company services, and now a Cyber Threat Intelligence Analyst, augmented by a 2nd Master’s Degree in Cybersecurity and Computer Forensics.
