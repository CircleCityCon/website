Luka began his information security career in the first grade arguing with his 1st-grade teacher than two finger typing was just fine while trying to get admin rights. He now helps small companies in complex regulatory environments build the best security and compliance programs possible, with a focus on healthcare. From HIPAA to TCPA and security architecture to Windows internals, he enjoys being involved with a little bit of everything and deep diving when the occasion calls for it.
