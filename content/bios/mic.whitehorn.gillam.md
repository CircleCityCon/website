Mic started coding at a young age, in the era a 5.25" floppy disks and 4-color displays. Some time later, he found his way to the internet and almost immediately started building websites. A decade later, he finally started to get paid to do just that. After another decade as a full-stack web dev, he crossed into info security - primarily on web and mobile app pen-testing, which is where he's stayed for the past couple years.
