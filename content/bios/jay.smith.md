Self teaching Reverse Engineer, Malware Analyst, DFIR practitioner, Twitter thread bomber and oft sh*tposter. I'm a proud Army veteran, baseball coach, husband and father to two sons (one of whom is living the con life with me) I absolutely love the InfoSec community and proudly stand on the shoulders of the giants who never tire of my needling for help, advice and guidance.
