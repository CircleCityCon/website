Jayson Brown has been an IT jobber since the late 90's. His knowledge is vast and deep when it comes to IT security. If you've seen it, heâ€™s probably built it, hacked it and secured it. In his spare time, he designs artisan punch cards for his in-house Mainframe that he uses to hack all the things. His current work allows him to yell at security analysts about the differences between NAT and port forwarding and securing enterprise level business operations as an Internal Penetration Tester.
