Glytch has been referred to as a real life MacGyver, making, breaking, (and fixing!) drones, robots, and other bits for over a decade. He’s designed and built dozens of 3d printed drones in various shapes and sizes. He focuses on optimizing and explaining the technologies underlying these projects to be human understandable, the results of which are viewable via his YouTube channel. He’s built projects such as Project Cuckoo, a drone for carrying a Hak5 WiFi Pineapple; General Chaos, a battlebot platform for serving mountain dew or launching rockets; a Wrench mask which tracks and displays the wearer’s eye expressions in real-time; deodorant-launching air cannons; an electric motorcycle using repurposed car parts; high performance computing rigs; as well as occasional repair and self sufficiency related videos.
