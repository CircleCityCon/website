Ross Wolf is a researcher at Endgame where he creates solutions to simplify detecting adversarial behavior in endpoint data. Prior to Endgame, Ross was an engineer at MITRE where he led projects that automated blue team processes by creating graphs of process activity and grouping related alerts. He was recently co-granted a patent for CALDERA, a project which automated post-compromise adversary emulation by chaining together attacker techniques. Ross also contributed to ATT&CK and the Cyber Analytics Repository.
