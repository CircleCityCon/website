Arden began his journey into IT in 1982 when he first learned to program computers, then quickly moved on to hacking BBS, PBX, and ICS systems. He joined the USAF in 1996 and for 15 years traveled the world doing various mysterious things with electrons. Arden was hand selected in the initial cadre of the Network Warfare Operations career field and tasked to develop the first Cyber Functional Training Unit where over the next three years he taught thousands of students everything from vulnerabilities in LMR/ICS/SS7 to basic computer programming to advanced exploitation & covert exfiltration. He finished his military career helping monitor & defend USAF networks at the AFCERT. After retiring from military service Arden ran the security operations team for a national financial services company until deciding to return to university to get his PhD.
