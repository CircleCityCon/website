Christian Burrows is a security practitioner from Austin, TX . He has 7+ years of experience in blue team / security incident response for various software companies. Some of his work includes helping to save the internet from really bad 0-days that were successfully used against companies he has worked for, spending entirely too much cumulative time in Splunk, reversing game hacks, and always trying to find bad stuff in prod environments. His speaking style is to not assume too much, to be efficient with time, and not read verbatim off of the presentation.
