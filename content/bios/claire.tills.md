Claire Tills recently received her M.A. in Communication from the University of Maryland. With a professional background in technology and security public relations, her research focuses on the communicative side of information security. She applies communication theories to infosec issues with the goal of advocating security to a variety of end-users and improving response after infosec crises like data breaches. Lately she's focused on the proactive side of infosec communication - how do we convince people to be better about security?
