Chris is currently the CSS for Attivo Networks, and is working on a number of projects within the deception and services space. Over the years, he's founded or worked with a number of companies specializing in DarkNet research, intelligence gathering, cryptography, deception technologies, and providers of security services and threat intelligence.

Since the late 90’s Chris has been deeply involved with security R&D, consulting, and advisory services in his quest to protect and defend businesses and individuals against cyber attack. Prior to that he jumped out of planes for a living, visiting all sorts of interesting countries and cultures while doing his best to avoid getting shot at too often. (Before that he managed to get various computers confiscated by a number of European entities.) 

Roberts is considered one of the world’s foremost experts on counter threat intelligence and vulnerability research within the Information Security industry.
