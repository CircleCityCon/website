### Submission Guidelines

1. Submission Title
2. Speaker Name(s)
3. Speaker Email (_this is how we will contact you_) **Hidden from reviewers**
4. Speaker biography (_150 words or less per speaker_) **Hidden from reviewers**
5. Abstract for your talk (_200 words or less_) **Please refrain from including identifying information**
6. Detailed talk outline **Please refrain from including identifying information**
7. Whether this would be your first speaking engagement at a conference
8. Whether this talk has been previously given at another conference
9. Shirt Size
10. Equipment Needs (_beyond internet access and AV equipment_)

If the submission is missing any of the above items, it will not be accepted. CircleCityCon reserves the right to throw out papers in which the authorâ€™s personal information is contained in the abstract or detailed outline.

We will do our best to accommodate equipment needs, but presenters are responsible for any equipment beyond internet access and A/V equipment provided.

### Review Process

Each CircleCityCon submitted talk will be double-blind reviewed (the reviewers do not see the author names and the authors do not see their reviewer names) by a committee of dedicated reviewers.

A final group of core conference staff will make a final judgement on each talk based on the comments provided by the double-blind review panel. Reviewers score talks based on a number of criteria included, but not limited to:

* Detail of submission
* Novelty of the talk
* Whether the talk has been given previously
* Whether the talk has been recorded previously

We offer two submission rounds for talks. CircleCityCon believes in feedback and education as part of the CFP process. With that in mind, we will send out clear acceptance and rejection letters at the end of each round, which will include feedback from reviewers.

**If your talk is not accepted in the first round, we strongly encourage you to rework your talk and resubmit in the second round.**

Accepted speakers will receive free admission to CircleCityCon, as well as a +1 ticket for a friend.
