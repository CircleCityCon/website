### Review Process

Each CircleCityCon submitted training will be double-blind reviewed (the reviewers do not see the author names and the authors do not see their reviewer names) by a committee of dedicated reviewers.

A final group of core conference staff will make a final judgement on each talk based on the comments provided by the double-blind review panel. Reviewers score talks based on a number of criteria included, but not limited to:

* Detail of submission
* Novelty of the training
* Whether the training has been given previously
* Whether the training has been recorded previously

We offer two submission rounds for talks. CircleCityCon believes in feedback and education as part of the CFP process. With that in mind, we will send out clear acceptance and rejection letters at the end of each round, which will include feedback from reviewers.

**If your talk is not accepted in the first round, we strongly encourage you to rework your talk and resubmit in the second round.**

Accepted speakers will receive free admission to CircleCityCon, as well as a +1 ticket for a friend.
