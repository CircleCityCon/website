title: "The Resilient Reddit C2"

---

Twitter is frequently utilized to issue commands to a botnet: an account creates a post that is ran by a program locally on a userâ€™s computer.  Why limit it to Twitter?  Reddit is a very viable platform that can be used to perform Command and Control operations while being able to blend in with other users as well as other network traffic.  By combining multiple accounts with the post structure of Reddit, a Command and Control Herder can be persistent even past account or post deletion.
