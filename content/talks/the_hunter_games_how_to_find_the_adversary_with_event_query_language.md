title: "The Hunter Games: How to find the adversary with Event Query Language"

---

How do you find malicious activity? We often resort to the cliche, *you know it when you see it*, but how do you even *see it*, without drowning in data? MITREâ€™s ATT&CK knowledge base organizes adversary behavior into tactics and techniques, and orients our approach to endpoint data. It suggests questions that might be worth asking, but not a way to ask them. The Event Query Language (EQL) allows a security analyst to naturally express queries for IOC search, hunting, and behavioral detections, while remaining platform and data source agnostic.

In this talk, I will demonstrate the iterative process of establishing situational awareness in your environment, creating targeted detections, and hunting for the adversary in your environment with real data, queries, and results.
