title: "Inside Out Security - Building Castles not Warehouses"

---

Medieval castle builders made effective use of simple design principles to defend the most valuable assets in their castles.  Centuries later there are clearly lessons we’ve forgotten that could help when it comes to how we defend our IT assets. From the moment we started to enable multi-user systems, we’ve gone about defending our information in all the wrong ways. In this session we’ll look at a completely different approach to designing security into our systems. We’ll look at new ways to understand what assets are, what threats those assets face, and how to leverage three basic types of defense mechanisms to effectively protect what we hold most dear. Ultimately you’ll learn how to bring technology and offensive security practices together into a cohesive defense approach that works. It’s time to defend your crown jewels inside a fortified castle rather than a thinly constructed warehouse.
