Hospitals can be attractive places for hackers. With access to critical medical records and personally identifiable information, there is great opportunity to exploit patients.
Privacy and the protection of computer records sometimes gets put on the back burner, and caring for the devices used in hospitals is an after-thought, meaning that computers and other devices are not updated in a timely manner and are prone to vulnerabilities. 
I see vulnerabilities on all levels and in all roles and locations in the hospital Ã¢&euro;&ldquo; in software, devices, and with humans.
The consequences of bad security are huge and can cause harm both to the patient and to employees. Criminal behaviour can go unnoticed for long periods.
Security needs to be built from the ground up so that employees understand the risks at all levels and can do all they can to protect the patient.

This presentation will expose the risks and vulnerabilities in hospitals and aims to start driving the discussion and generation of ideas for procedures to avoid the dangerous pitfalls that put lives in peril. My goal is to ensure that we create a safe and secure environment for our patients and employees.
