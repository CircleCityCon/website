title: "Do You Have What It Takes? How to Support Your Career From Community Involvement"

---

Career development is typically seen as a progression of education, certification and job moves. For career development it is helpful to build both technical and non-technical skills in environments that challenge and support learning. One way to build these skills is through volunteering. Community involvement strengthens our community and provides opportunities to stretch and learn new skills. Having worked with a large community of long-time volunteers, I will share share their volunteering and career paths to illustrate their lessons learned and opportunities gained. I will share how to incorporate this in your current job and engage with your employer as well as provide tips on how to include community volunteering into your next job search. Finally, all of this information will be supported by sharing results from a recent survey on community volunteering and career development.
