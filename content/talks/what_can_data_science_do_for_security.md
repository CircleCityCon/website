title: "What Can Data Science Do for Security?"

---

We present a high-level overview of how data science is used to extract insights from security data.  Data science is an interdisciplinary field encompassing math, statistics, information science and computer science that gleans actionable information from data.  With cybersecurity, data science often attempts to differentiate between the normal and the malicious.  Data science has been applied to network security monitoring and malware analysis.  We discuss some general principles and terminology and walk through examples.
