This talk explains with relevant and up to date examples, how flaws in app privacy can affect user safety and privacy.  We need to consider end user privacy more and offer end users more transparency in how their information is used. I will show how apps such as some messaging services work well for some groups but fail other targeted groups.  The aim is to encourage thought and discussion around privacy for targeted groups and an awareness of their needs.
