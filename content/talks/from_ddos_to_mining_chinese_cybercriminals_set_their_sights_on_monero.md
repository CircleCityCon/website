This presentation will take an in-depth look at illicit cryptocurrency mining activity conducted by Chinese cybercriminals. It will begin by examining the trend toward cryptocurrency attacks in general. Then it will focus on China, looking at the country√¢&euro;&trade;s cryptocurrency environment, and examining how some Chinese actors are transitioning from DDoS to mining-focused attacks. Then it will analyze tools and techniques, looking at Monero mining and hacking tools purchased on Chinese forums as well as malware samples collected through honeypots and Chinese social media platforms. Finally, it will address ways to mitigate the threat, through blacklisting, collecting samples, and using human intelligence.
