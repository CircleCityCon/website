Not all binaries were created equal--, some are small, some are big, and some can be abused to gain arbitrary code execution. In this talk, I’ll demo how tens of popular, already-installed binaries in popular OS’s such as Linux, FreeBSD, Oracle Solaris, macOS etc. can be turned into backdoors with just one command-line. The icing on the cake? That one command-line won’t change the content or size of binaries, it will only change the metadata. Come see how you can save disk space and bandwidth in your next red team / penetration testing engagement.
