Technical skills are of little value if they cannot be put to work, which is to say, put in context. While specialization, and even hyperspecialization can provide certain advantages, it comes at a cost: the inability to adjust to changes outside of one's field of expertise. It is no secret that demand for "security professionals" is high, that barriers to entry are great, and that rate of burnout is high. What starts as specialization ends with pigeonholed: trapped in a position that is unrewarding. We introduce the *Operator*: a hacker with not only depth of knowledge, but important breadth, and the ability to apply the combination of skills to problems and opportunities encountered over a lifetime.
