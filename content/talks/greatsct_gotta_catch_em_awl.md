Great Scott Marty, we went all the way back to 1995! The project is called Great SCT (Great Scott). GreatSCT is an open source project to generate application whitelist (AWL) bypasses. This tool is intended for BOTH red and blue team. Blue team can benefit by testing the publicly known application whitelisting bypass methods. We will review the most common application whitelisting bypass methods and how to utilize these methods with GreatSCT.
