title: "Catching the Guerrilla: Powershell Counterinsurgency"

---

For too long attackers have leveraged the built-in APIs and tooling on Windows systems against us. It's time the tables are turned! Those APIs were made for Sys Admins and defenders... and we're taking them back!  **We're building a framework of response tools for defenders to wrestle control from threat actors without the risk of production outages.** This talk will focus on techniques to turn the limited and traditional black-and-white incident response options into a full-color spectrum of alternatives for defending your turf. Attendees will walk away with ideas on how to leverage existing third-party Powershell scripts to stop intruders in their tracks and are encouraged to offer use cases that will produce more tools in the future.
