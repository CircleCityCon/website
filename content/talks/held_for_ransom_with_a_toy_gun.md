While most people panic at the sight of a ransomware note, many of the malware families are actually weak and feeble. Some don't even work at all. Based off long-term research, this talk will poke fun at some weird and unusual ransomware that are fake or so badly written that they're easily bypassed and recovered from. Learn which threats are real, which are mildly painful, and which can be laughed off, and how to tell the difference.
