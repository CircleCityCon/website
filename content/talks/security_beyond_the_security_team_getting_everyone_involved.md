Security is about all of us. Technical and non-technical. Copywriters, engineers, assistants, and executives. In a world filled with an endless stream of zero-days and protection against advanced threats, most attacks are still credential phishing, stolen devices, open ports, and noisy malware that only works if you haven't patched in months. This talk takes a step outside the confines of the security team and explores what it looks like when everyone is involved in security. We’ll talk about how to build a culture of security from the ground up, what it means to empower people, and how to do it. We’ll also look at a real-life example of what it looks like to have everyone confident, empowered, and ready to act by recapping a real incident response to the Google Docs phishing campaign from May 2017.
