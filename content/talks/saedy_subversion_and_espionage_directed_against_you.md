“Frequently, people who go along a treasonous path do not know they are on a treasonous path until it is too late”, per testimony of former CIA Director John Brennan, 2017. Definition of social engineering (SE): “any act that influences a person to take an action that may or may not be in their best interest”. Using an old US Army acronym called SAEDA, Subversion and Espionage Directed Against the Army, will discuss how today’s use of SE is essentially trade craft of espionage, commonly known as spying. 

"There is no patch for an untrained user or even an experienced security professional who forgets, in the heat of the moment, to follow what they have been taught." 

Espionage is the practice of secretly gathering information about a foreign government or competing industry, with the objective of placing one’s own government or corporation at a strategic or financial advantage. Presenting personal experiences as an Army counterintelligence agent with examples of military and industrial espionage, will illustrate how tricks of the spy trade are parleyed against ordinary individuals every day. Goal: induce individuals to be self-aware and execute behavioral change, as today’s cyber threat landscape is essentially ‘them against you’.
