Hackers understand how to gather the data....the difference here is a spy master knows how to use it to leverage the target into spying for them..  The details matter the most, but knowing your target is equally important.

This talk is unique to this conference because it focuses around the theme of spycraft.  This talk is designed to get the audience to understand what a spy master looks for and it will help reduce the risk of them being exploited and targeted by an adversary.   This talk will only be at Circle City Con.
