title: "5G: Security Pitfalls and Considerations"

---

5G networks leverage cutting-edge technologies such as software-defined networking (SDN) and network functions virtualization (NFV) to meet the requirements of broadband access everywhere.  SDN and NFV in turn leverage advances in cloud technologies such as mobile edge computing (MEC) to meet ease of integration requirements. However, securely using these technologies and maintaining user privacy in future wireless networks are concerns that have not been adequately addressed. This talk provides an overview of security and user privacy challenges associated with cloud computing, SDN and NFV.  The talk details courses of action to address these challenges and security roadmap for 5G systems.
