We need to talk about Adware, A threat which is often being ignored by security professionals because “they just display ads”. Furthermore, security companies often classify adware as “PuPs” of “Potentially unwanted programs” and thus ‘downplaying’ on the actual risks and dangers that they impose by looking at the new version of OSX/Pirrit, a very aggressive adware for the Mac that I discovered. In this talk I will show you just how serious adware can really be, I will walk the attendees through my thought process and I will show how to analyze and reverse engineer malware for macs, which tricks malware authors are using for persistence and many other tidbits of information about security research on the mac. I will also share the background story behind my analysis of OSX/Pirrit which its authors decided to send me legal threat letters and how the only difference between adware and malware is the fact that adware companies have legal departments. From analyzing huge shell scripts to binary REing with IDA pro and even C&C; domain research - This talk has it all.
