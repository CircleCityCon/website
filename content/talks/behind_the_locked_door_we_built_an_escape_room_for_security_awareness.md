title: "Behind The Locked Door: we built an escape room for security awareness"

---

People **want** to attend our internal security awareness and training programs. In fact, we ran out of slots and had to turn colleagues away! We did it on a budget, too. We created an infosec-themed escape room which was educational, fun, cheap, and got great reviews. Weâ€™ll share what worked, what can be improved, and publish some of our awareness materials and puzzles along with this talk.
