OSINT (open source intelligence) techniques are commonly used today in both infosec and investigations. OSINT gathering for pentesting engagements, or subject identification is fairly well documented. A less commonly known technique is geolocation of images and video. Geolocation is regularly used by intelligence analysts and journalists to find the exact location of a subject or event. Some of these techniques were recently used by members of the imageboard website 4chan in their “investigations”. This presentation will dive into some of these methods. These include what you can get out of metadata besides geotags, using context behind the photographer, and analysis of content in the images themselves.
