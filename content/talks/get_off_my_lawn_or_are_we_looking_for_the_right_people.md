title: "Get off my lawn… or are we looking for the right people?"

Time have changed, paths have changed, heck the only thing constant is change. Therefor what we must look for to hire should change, but has it? There are some people and companies that are willing to take chances on people that are a bit outside the “norm” for our industry, but should those people be outside the norm? with our shortage of people, and the low numbers of diversification of people in our field isn’t it time we changed our parameters a bit?
