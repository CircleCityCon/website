In this talk, we'll take a deep-dive into Android application analysis and reverse engineering techniques.

We'll discuss application lifecycles, black-box static analysis of DEX files, bypassing application security features, application memory analysis, and dynamic debugging techniques. We'll also briefly touch on native code, obfuscation, and recent Android security features.

By the end of this talk, attendees will be able to analyze application logic, re-engineer applications to add debugging features or bypass security measures, and understand the general lifecycles of Android applications. The techniques discussed can be used for bypassing application defenses (such as root checks and certificate pinning) and backdooring applications for red-team assessments.

This talk is targeted at users with an intermediate understanding of Android application assessments.
