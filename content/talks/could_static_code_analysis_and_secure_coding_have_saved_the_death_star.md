title: "Could Static Code Analysis and Secure Coding have Saved the Death Star?"

---

Could a scan of the Empire’s Death Star software have found the insider threat that Galen Erso left in the Death Star’s system? My hypothesis is that if the Empire had used a Static Analysis Tool for issues, then maybe the outcome of the Star Wars movies would have been different.

The teacher will explain the terms “Secure Coding” or “Static Code Analysis” and give associated examples.
