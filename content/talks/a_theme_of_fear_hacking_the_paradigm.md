title: "A Theme of Fear: Hacking the Paradigm"

---

The InfoSec industry was born out of fear. Initially it was fear from virus infections and later, external attacks.  We capitalized on that fear to build more secure environments.   But fear is hard to manage: too much fear breeds paralysis, and too little fear breeds complacency.  This talk will take a look at the history of fear in InfoSec, explore how its impact has shaped the industry, and how it is now getting in the way. Fortunately, we can provide the next generation a new paradigm to affect change. This talk presents some ideas on what the new security paradigm could be, and most importantly - how to enable a security-minded culture without using fear.
