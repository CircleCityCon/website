title: "Endpoint Security, Swimming Through the Snake Oil"

---

Many vendors try to sell you snake oil and wine/dine you during the review process then leave you high and dry afterwards.  This talk focuses on how to do full tests of endpoint products to make sure you know what you are really getting into and not just being sold some fancy snake oil.  The talk focuses on the technical aspects of the testing as well as the functionality of the product in your own environment.  This is an ideal topic for blue team members as well as anyone who manages endpoints in an organization.
