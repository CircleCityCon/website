User awareness training is often viewed as a necessary evil-one more thing we must do in order to check the box. We either outsource our training to a third party, never paying attention to it again until we need to review our subscription, or we run it internally and spend as little time on it as possible. As a result, our users are no better prepared for security threats and they are not learning while seeing it as an annoyance or obstruction, and not a learning experience.

This talk aims to change this and starts by discussing possible metrics that can be used to gauge the effectiveness of the program and level of engagement and impact on users and other departments your organization's user awareness program has. Once we talk about how to track the impact of your program, we will move on to how habit formation and key concepts in motivation can positively influence your users' security habits and the success of your program.
