title: "Security lessons from the Woofmutt…"

---

Life, and all of its lessons can come from many directions, in this instance I’m going to take a step back from the normal avenues and focus on what a pair of large Great Danes have helped me learn about our industry…some thoughts below:
•	Puppy eyes, drool AND sideways looks work…social engineering IS a good skill to have
•	Try everything at least once, even if it means sticking your head in the trashcan…
•	Always be upfront, that way there’s no miscommunication
•	If at first you fail, try again; eventually you will get the chew toy on top of the bookcase.
These lessons and more will be covered, dissected AND somehow related to us as humans and technologists. All discussed while waving hands on, and with the normal sarcastic humor levels.
