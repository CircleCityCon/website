title: "I’ll Complete My Threat Model Later Mom!: Infosec in Middle School."

---

Infosec in middle school? It’s less likely than you think! Security education initiatives and curricula are being creating and piloted in various school districts all over the country. However, many of those initiatives are currently focused in either high school or post-secondary education. There are few security education initiatives that target middle school students. In this talk, I will briefly explain about computer science and security initiatives in the United States. I will share lesson resources and discuss how the industry can potentially help with these initiatives.Through education, students can become more aware of the security threats around them and potentially become inspired to pursue a career in information security.
