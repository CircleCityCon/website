title: "Creating browser extension to hunt low hanging fruits"

---

Automated scanners wonâ€™t yield you bugs these days. They take tens of hours to get completed that too with a high false rate. You need a minimal smart scanner with easy installation, easy configuration, and relatively high accuracy while hunting for bugs. This talk is focused on creating such a browser extension to yield better results in less time. The browser extension requires less manual effort and produces more accurate results in just a few seconds.
