title: "Training and Education for the New Realities of Privacy and Security"

---

The recent security events over the past year have proven that technology is not enough in defending against cyber-attacks.  Attack techniques such as BGP and DNS Hijacking, and privacy issues such as unauthorized Electronic Medical Record accesses donâ€™t get detected by traditional tools and techniques.  Our best weapon in this case is our end users.  In this session, Mitch Parker, Executive Director of Information Security and Compliance at IU Health will discuss the training and education techniques used to inform a team of over 34,500 and build two-way communication.
