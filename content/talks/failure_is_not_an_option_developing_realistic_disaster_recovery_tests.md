title: "Failure Is Not an Option: Developing Realistic Disaster Recovery Tests"

---

Disaster Recovery isn't exciting or prestigious, but recent real world examples have shown the consequences for failing to create and test an effective plan. Building a clear, flexible plan will let you recover gracefully from an outage and meet your service requirements. This talk will lay out how to model failures in your environment, create and document a plan for recovery, and test it thoroughly. Prepare your team to respond to a disaster (be it environmental, fire, or ransomware to name a few).
