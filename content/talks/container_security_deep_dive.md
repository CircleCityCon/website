title: "Container Security Deep Dive"

---

Containers are the next big thing in virtualization technology.  If configured properly they provide immense security. There are many different segments where a container deployment needs to be secured like Dockerfile , docker daemon, container  images , monitoring within containers etc. Attending this talk will help you secure your deployments the container way.

I will start this talk with a brief intro to containers, talk about how a typical container deployment pipeline looks like. We will look at the different security checkpoints you can have within the deployment pipeline , what can be achieved at each of these checkpoints and things to watch out for.Next I will point out the different configuration options that you should pay attention to in order to achieve complete coverage and also scale effectively. Lastly I will talk about some challenges we faced at Twilio and strategies to overcome them.
