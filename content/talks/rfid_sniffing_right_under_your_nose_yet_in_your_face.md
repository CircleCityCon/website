title: "RFID sniffing, right under your nose yet in your face."

During a monthly onsite check-in with our client, we noticed they upgraded the RFID scanners on their building. When we asked about it in our meeting, our clients said they hadn't noticed. We came up with a psychological experiment on the spot. Let us create an badge skimmer akin to some of the ATM scanners we've all seen, and lets see if the workforce notices. We noticed other items in and around their buildings as well as other clients we thought we may be able to take advantage of. This talk is not a tale of easy conquest or having a laugh at what went unnoticed (to be fair that is in here); but rather a talk about how hard it is to change and alter behavior around technology everyone takes for granted.
