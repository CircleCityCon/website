title: "A Few Things Right: Insights from Live and Simulated Incident Response"

---

While we continue to support the concepts of compliance, defense, governance, and prevention, it's time to shift our focus beyond those measures with more emphasis on strategic response to incidents. This talk offers real stories of failure and practical, quick-win lessons on how to be prepared to respond quickly, accurately, and confidently when incidents occur. Because they will occur. Doing a few, important things well means opening our hearts and minds to a new way of thinking and learning about each other and what it means to be prepared for a crisis.
