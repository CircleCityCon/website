Many of the top security vendors, InfoSec specialist, and cyber security professional are claiming how artificial intelligence and machine learning are changing the face of defending against the most advanced attacks. Most vendors fail to be transparent on how these technologies work. We are bombarded with buzzwords, yet we don't understand what they mean, what the technology does, and how we should keep vendors accountable. When we look for the details on the specifics of what makes these products effective we are usually given vague answers or told it is a proprietary technology. The truth is there is no magic behind machine learning. 

This talk will examine the details behind the mechanics on artificial intelligence and machine learning. How different techniques are being used to detect malware, malicious domains, phishing emails, and other threats. We will examine how these systems need to be setup, trained, and what are some of the inherent weaknesses built into them.

We will examine why these technologies fail and how attackers routinely bypass these methods for detection to infiltrate systems. Attendees will learn about advance attacker techniques and how hackers are using machine learning against organizations that use them.
