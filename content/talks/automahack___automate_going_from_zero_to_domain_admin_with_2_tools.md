Automate the most common attack paths to go from outside an Active Directory network to domain admin with 2 tools. Icebreaker.py runs 4 different network attacks to capture plaintext credentials and hashes which are autocracked. Plug these credentials into DeathStar.py and watch yourself go from potentially unprivileged user straight to domain admin in only a few keystrokes.
