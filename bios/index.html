She once read on The Onion that researchers at the University of North Carolina released a comprehensive report in 2014 confirming her status as the &ldquo;most significant and interesting person currently inhabiting the earth&rdquo;, and it was on &lsquo;teh internet&rsquo; so it must be true.</p>
