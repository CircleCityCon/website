We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description>

      <description>CircleCityCon is a security conference held in downtown Indianapolis. Our cons last years were big successes and we are only looking to grow and make it better.
CircleCityCon is about the community. Our signature offering is the community led training classes offered to all participants. Events and contests are organized by members of the security community, including both CircleCityCon staffers and community partners. Three tracks, incredible entertainment, and technical villages help round out the CircleCityCom experience.</description>

      <description>Code of Conduct We have no tolerance for physical/verbal/sexual harassment of any human!
Our “Code of Conduct” is “Be Excellent to Each Other” AKA the Golden Rule. Failing that, it is “Do not be an Ass* or we will kick your ass out!”.
Asking questions of a speaker during their talk, to get clarity or debate a point is not being an ass – heckling or haranguing the speaker is.</description>
