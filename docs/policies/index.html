<h1 id="code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</h1>

<p>We have <strong>no tolerance</strong> for physical/verbal/sexual harassment of any human!</p>

<p>Our “Code of Conduct” is “Be Excellent to Each Other” AKA the Golden Rule.
Failing that, it is “Do not be an Ass* or we will kick your ass out!”.</p>

<p>Asking questions of a speaker during their talk, to get clarity or debate a point is <strong>not</strong> being an ass – heckling or haranguing the speaker <strong>is</strong>. If you are not sure, ask, or err on the side of basic decency and common courtesy. If what they are doing would not be acceptable to have done to you, your best friend, your worst enemy, your sister, niece, daughter, brother, nephew, son, mother, father, or any human being, do not let them treat anyone else that way – whether you know them or not. If someone asks you to stop – stop.</p>

<p>If you are having an issue with a CircleCityCon participant of <strong>any</strong> badge type, find a radioed member of our Security Operations Team in the red CircleCityCon t-shirts (or any staff member, in purple shirts). They will call our Safety &amp; Medical Response Team (S.M.R.T), who will assist you in determining the next steps for you to feel safe and heard.</p>

<p><em><strong>Staff reserves the right to determine what constitutes “Being an Ass”.</strong></em></p>

<hr />

<h1 id="photo-video-recording-devices">Photo/Video/Recording Devices</h1>

<p>Ensure you have the permission from anyone you photograph or record. This includes those in the background of your shot. “Crowd shots” from the front (facing the crowd) are strongly discouraged.</p>

<p>If you’ve accidentally taken a picture without permission, delete it. If you are asked by a participant to delete/blur a picture they did not give you permission to take, do so immediately.</p>

<p>We ask Press photographers to adhere to this policy, as well. A Press badge is not a pass to break these rules.</p>

<p>Upon a first infraction, you will receive one warning from CircleCityCon Staff. Upon a second infraction you will be asked to give up your device to CircleCityCon Security Operations staff for the duration of the Con or to leave the Con with your device, your choice. You may return to the Con once you have deposited your device in a secure location, offsite.</p>

<p>There are official CircleCityCon Photographers circling around the event. All will be in Purple Staff Shirts and have Staff badges. They are aware of this policy and are not immune, except in cases where they have been requested to document activities, official parties, presentations, etc., for CircleCityCon PR purposes. If you believe that any staff photographers are breaking these rules, or abusing their privilege, please bring it to the attention of CircleCityCon Security Operations (Red Shirts) or Conference Staff (Purple Shirts).</p>

<p>Thank you for your cooperation!</p>
